# Project Background

SHH is actively allocating resources towards the pursuit of securing earned media coverage, 
recognizing its potential to inspire donor engagement and prompt action. 

However, presently, there lacks a reliable means of measuring and quantifying the precise 
influence that earned media has on individuals' decisions to contribute donations. 

Consequently, the task of devising an impactful media strategy becomes increasingly arduous, 
as it necessitates navigating the intricacies of determining where to allocate resources 
effectively and accurately predicting the outcomes of media exposure.

# Problem Statement

* How different media channels drive donations outcomes for SHH? Which earned media channel to focus on?
* How can Second Harvest Heartland (SHH) predict donation activity in relation to media exposure?
